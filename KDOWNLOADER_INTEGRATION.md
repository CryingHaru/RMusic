# KDownloader Integration Implementation

## Overview
Successfully integrated the KDownloader library into RMusic project to enhance download functionality with pause/resume support, better error handling, and improved user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`)
- Added KDownloader library dependency: `kdownloader = { module = "com.github.varungulatii:Kdownloader", version = "1.0.4" }`

### 2. Download Module (`download/build.gradle.kts`)
- Added KDownloader dependency to the download module

### 3. New KDownloadProvider (`download/src/main/kotlin/com/rmusic/download/KDownloadProvider.kt`)
- Created a new download provider that wraps KDownloader functionality
- Implements the existing `DownloadProvider` interface for compatibility
- Features:
  - Pause/resume support with persistent state
  - Progress tracking with file size information
  - Error handling with retry capabilities
  - Database integration for resumable downloads
  - Cleanup functionality for old partial downloads

### 4. Enhanced DownloadManager (`download/src/main/kotlin/com/rmusic/download/DownloadManager.kt`)
- Updated constructor to accept Android Context for KDownloadProvider initialization
- Modified provider selection logic to prefer KDownloader when available
- Added methods for cleanup and canceling all downloads
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 5. Updated MusicDownloadService (`app/src/main/kotlin/com/rmusic/android/service/MusicDownloadService.kt`)
- Added KDownloadProvider to the providers map
- Updated provider selection to use KDownloader by default
- Added cleanup functionality accessible via service intents
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

### 6. KDownloader Settings UI (`app/src/main/kotlin/com/rmusic/android/ui/screens/settings/KDownloaderSettings.kt`)
- Created a dedicated settings screen for KDownloader management
- Features:
  - Active downloads monitoring
  - Pause/resume all downloads functionality
  - Cancel all downloads with confirmation dialog
  - Cleanup old files functionality
  - Information about KDownloader features

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Download Management
- **Pause/Resume**: Individual downloads can be paused and resumed
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress with download/total bytes
- **Queue Management**: Multiple downloads can run in parallel
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with retry mechanisms

### 2. Persistent Downloads
- Downloads survive app restarts
- Resume capability for interrupted downloads
- Database storage for download metadata

### 3. Better User Experience
- Real-time progress updates
- Notification support (inherited from existing implementation)
- Batch operations (pause all, resume all, cancel all)

### 4. Maintenance Features
- Cleanup old partial downloads
- Remove stale database entries
- Clear temporary files

## Usage

### Starting a Download
```kotlin
// Downloads now automatically use KDownloader
MusicDownloadService.download(
    context = context,
    trackId = "unique_track_id",
    title = "Song Title",
    artist = "Artist Name",
    album = "Album Name",
    url = "download_url"
)
```

### Managing Downloads
```kotlin
// Pause a download
MusicDownloadService.pause(context, trackId)

// Resume a download
MusicDownloadService.resume(context, trackId)

// Cancel a download
MusicDownloadService.cancel(context, trackId)

// Cleanup old files (7 days)
MusicDownloadService.cleanUp(context, 7)
```

### Accessing Settings
Navigate to Settings â†’ KDownloader Settings to access the new management interface.

## Technical Benefits

1. **Reliability**: KDownloader provides battle-tested download functionality
2. **Performance**: Optimized for large file downloads with chunked downloading
3. **Resumability**: Native support for resuming interrupted downloads
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming downloads without loading entire files into memory
5. **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

## Future Enhancements

1. **Download Notifications**: Enhanced notification system with KDownloader integration
2. **Download Scheduling**: Queue management with priority levels
3. **Bandwidth Management**: Speed limiting and WiFi-only downloads
4. **Advanced UI**: Progress bars, speed indicators, ETA calculations

## Testing

The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing download functionality while adding KDownloader's enhanced features. All existing download flows continue to work, now with improved reliability and user control.
